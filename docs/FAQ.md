## Project Setup

### What do I need to run CueLABS™ locally?

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js (version specified in `.nvmrc`)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git for version control
- A GitHub account for authentication
- An Airtable account for database functionality

**External Services:**

- Airtable base for data storage
- GitHub OAuth app for authentication

### How long does setup typically take?

For most developers:

- **First-time setup**: 15-30 minutes
- **Experienced developers**: 10-15 minutes
- **With existing Airtable/GitHub setup**: 5-10 minutes

The setup time depends on whether you need to create new Airtable bases and GitHub OAuth apps.

### Do I need to pay for any services?

**Free tiers available:**

- **Airtable**: Free tier supports up to 1,200 records per base
- **GitHub**: Free for public repositories and OAuth apps
- **Vercel**: Free tier for personal projects

**Paid services (optional):**

- Airtable Pro for larger datasets
- Vercel Pro for production deployments with custom domains

### Can I contribute without setting up the full environment?

Yes! You can contribute in several ways without a full local setup:

- **Documentation improvements**: Edit markdown files directly on GitHub
- **Bug reports**: Report issues you find
- **Feature requests**: Suggest new features
- **Code review**: Review pull requests from other contributors
- **Testing**: Test new features and provide feedback

### What should I work on as a first-time contributor?

Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue`: Perfect for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Community help needed
- `documentation`: Documentation improvements
- `bug`: Bug fixes (often straightforward)

### How do I claim an issue to work on?

1. Comment on the issue saying you'd like to work on it
2. Wait for a maintainer to assign it to you
3. Start working within a reasonable timeframe
4. Ask questions if you need clarification

## Technical Questions

### What technology stack does CueLABS™ use?

**Frontend:**

- Next.js 15 with App Router
- React 19
- TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS 4
- shadcn/ui components

**State Management:**

- Redux Toolkit for global state
- TanStack Query for server state
- NextAuth.js for authentication

**Backend/Services:**

- Airtable for database
- GitHub OAuth for authentication
- Vercel for deployment

### Why Airtable instead of a traditional database?

Airtable provides several advantages for this project:

- **Rapid prototyping**: Quick to set up and modify
- **Visual interface**: Easy to manage data without SQL
- **API-first**: Excellent REST API with good documentation
- **Collaboration**: Non-technical team members can manage data
- **Cost-effective**: Free tier suitable for development

### Can I use a different database?

While the current implementation uses Airtable, the architecture is designed to be flexible. You could potentially:

- Create database adapters for other services
- Implement a traditional SQL database backend
- Use other headless CMS solutions

However, this would require significant changes to the data layer.

### What's the deployment process?

**Development:**

```bash
npm run dev  # Local development server
```

**Production:**

- **Vercel**: Automatic deployment from GitHub
- **Manual**: `npm run build && npm start`
- **Docker**: Container deployment (configuration needed)

### How do I add new features?

1. **Create an issue**: Describe the feature and get feedback
2. **Design discussion**: Discuss implementation approach
3. **Create a branch**: Use descriptive branch names
4. **Implement**: Follow existing code patterns
5. **Test**: Ensure your feature works correctly
6. **Document**: Update relevant documentation
7. **Submit PR**: Follow the pull request template

## Troubleshooting

### Where can I find help with setup issues?

1. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Check `docs/setup/troubleshooting.md`

3. **Community Discussions**: Ask questions in GitHub Discussions
4. **Documentation**: Review setup guides in `docs/setup/`

### My development server won't start. What should I check?

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Port in use**: Kill process on port 3000 or use different port
2. **Missing dependencies**: Run `npm install`
3. **Environment variables**: Check `.env` file exists and is complete
4. **Node.js version**: Use version specified in `.nvmrc`
5. **Cache issues**: Clear `.next` folder and restart

### Authentication isn't working. What's wrong?

Check these common issues:

1. **GitHub OAuth setup**: Verify client ID, secret, and callback URL
2. **NextAuth configuration**: Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_URL` are set
3. **Environment variables**: Verify all auth-related variables are correct
4. **Browser cookies**: Ensure cookies are enabled
5. **HTTPS requirements**: Some auth features require HTTPS in production

### I'm getting Airtable connection errors. How do I fix this?

1. **API Key**: Verify your Airtable personal access token
2. **Base ID**: Ensure the base ID matches your Airtable base
3. **Table structure**: Verify tables and fields match the expected schema
4. **Permissions**: Check your Airtable permissions allow API access
5. **Rate limits**: Airtable has API rate limits; check if you're exceeding them
